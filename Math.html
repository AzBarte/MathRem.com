<p><font size ="5"><font face="Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s time to celebrate math! lt is March Mathematics Awareness Month, held each year to increase the visibility of mathematics as a field of study and to communicate the power and intrigue in mathematics. This year’s theme is “The Future of Prediction,” focusing on the ways in which math and statistics play a role in providing planning data and driving innovation for the future.
Mathematics Awareness Month began in 1986 with a proclamation by President Ronald Reagan, who believed the application of math is indispensable in such fields as medicine, computer sciences, space exploration, the skilled trades, business, defense and government. Yet, despite the increasing importance of mathematics to the progress of our economy and society, enrollment in mathematics programs has been declining at all levels of the American educational system.
You can help the effort by creating some math excitement at your school!

 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Math Forum Year Game
A great way to celebrate Math Month is to participate in Math Forum’s “year games.” Every year Math Forum hosts this game electronically for all interested students, mathematicians, scientists or engineers. The game is both fun and challenging.
Mathematics is a fundamental part of human thought and logic, and integral to attempts at understanding the world and ourselves. Mathematics provides an effective way of building mental discipline and encourages logical reasoning and mental rigor. In addition, mathematical knowledge plays a crucial role in understanding the contents of other school subjects such as science, social studies, and even music and art.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this TSG is to investigate the role of mathematics in the overall curriculum. Due to the wide range of possible issues that could be addressed in this TSG, we plan to organize the papers and accompanying discussions into three key strands.
Firstly, we ask the question: why does mathematics hold such an important and unique place among other subjects? That is, what is the significance of mathematics in the overall school curriculum? As a point of departure, we offer a few thoughts on why mathematics should be treated as an important subject in overall curriculum.
- Mathematics has a transversal nature. If we reflect on the history of curriculum in general, then mathematics (geometry and algebra) were two of the seven liberal arts in Greek as well as in medieval times. This historical role supports the notion that mathematics has provided the mental discipline required for other disciplines.
